This project extracts and identifies Gujarati text from images using YOLO for word detection, Canny Edge & Contour for character segmentation, and EfficientNetB3 for classification. Trained on the Kaggle Gujarati OCR dataset (78k images), it achieved 97% accuracy.

Applications are :-
1.Digital archiving of Gujarati documents.
2.Automated processing for forms and handwritten text.
3.Addressing the lack of proper NLP datasets in Gujarati by digitizing historical documents and papers from past decades.
